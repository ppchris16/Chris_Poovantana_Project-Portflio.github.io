											In my current role, I'm responsible for overseeing the integration of various electrical components onto the chassis CAD file. 
											This involves not only understanding the functions of each electrical part but also strategically planning their placement while considering electrical constraints. 
											The goal is to ensure that the electrical boards, even when exposed to challenging conditions like water and harsh weather, perform optimally and efficiently.<br>
											Part of my job includes designing and creating sturdy enclosures for all these electrical components mounted on the chassis. 
											These enclosures need to be able to handle the vibrations generated by the vehicle and motor operations, while also be easily accessible for maintenance purporses.
											To keep things cost-effective, I focus on manufacturing techniques that are both straightforward and budget-friendly.

											<p>As part of my role, I took on the responsibility of designing enclosures for each individual component of the project. 
												This involved creating protective and efficient housing solutions that ensured the safety and functionality of the components. 
												Additionally, I had the opportunity to collaborate closely with the electrical lead to develop a robust connection and wiring system for the entire board.
												 This collaboration allowed us to establish a well-organized and reliable setup that contributed to the seamless operation of the project. Working together 
												 with the electrical lead not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided valuable insights into the intricate interplay between design and functionality 
												 in a complex project like ours.</p>

												 <i>Note: The sketch of the major wiring connection is shown</i>
												 

											<p><br>To sucesfully complete the project, I utilized both Skecthing Techniques and Solidworkd CAD software. 
											    This dynamic combination allows me to innovate robust enclosure designs.
												Besides that, I also conducted a material reserach and manufacturing techniques that would result in an optimal enclosure design. 
												After conducting an extensive reserch, 
												<br>it is presented that <strong>Thermoforming and 3D Printing Techiniques</strong> are the 
												optimal and cost effective ways to implement the production of the enclosures.

												<br>Collaboration is at the heart of this project. I work closely with various teams, such as the Low Voltage System team, Software team, Vehicle Dynamics team, and Aeroshell team. 
												This collaborative effort is crucial to make sure that the placement and mounting of each board don't interfere with components developed by other teams. 
												Through these interactions, I've not only gained technical skills but also improved my communication and teamwork abilities.

									<h2>Project:Weldment Tube Notch Trimming for Production</h2>
									<p>@UBC Solar Design Team<br>
										<span class="date">January 2023 - April 2023</span></p>

								<div class="box">

										My primary responsibility centers around conducting structural analyses on the connecting tubes of our car's chassis. 
										This involves delving into the intricate details of welding profiles that complement the chosen materials. 
										These two pivotal aspects play a direct role in shaping the overall performance and functionality of the car chassis.
										 It's evident that within the untrimmed section, the meshing of tubes leads to pronounced internal stress concentration at those junctions. 
										 In stark contrast, when the tubes are trimmed, this stress concentration significantly diminishes.
										 A crucial precursor to the actual chassis manufacturing process is trimming the mesh points of the tubes. 
										Throughout this undertaking, 
										 
										<br>I've closely followed the <a href="https://vr3.ca/">@VR3 production guidlines </a>, a set of trimming regulations. 
										<br>The VR3 method stands out due to its innovative approach 
										â€“ it extracts cutting profile data straight from a 3D model. This process takes into consideration key factors like wall thickness and intersection geometry, 
										ensuring a comprehensive 100% contact along the perimeter.
										This engagement underscores my proficiency in <strong>structural analysis, welding intricacies, and the art of manufacturability</strong>.
										 It also showcases my adeptness in navigating detailed protocols like the VR3 trimming procedure. This hands-on experience 
										 and in-depth comprehension of chassis dynamics add a significant dimension to my growing project portfolio.<br>

								<h2>Project:Tube Naming Convention</h2>
								<p>@UBC Solar Design Team<br>
									<span class="date">January 2023 - April 2023</span></p>

									Beyond my involvement in the trimming of all the tube nodes of the chassis structure, 
									I also took initiative on the tas of developiing a structured naming convention for the UBC Solar Design team. 
									This nomenclature serves as a convenient way to identify each distinct tube profile within our car's chassis.
									The utility of this chassis naming convention extends beyond my immediate responsibilities. 
									Multiple subteams at UBC Solar, including Vehicle Dynamics and Manufacturing teams, benefit from this framework.
									 A clear and coherent naming convention not only simplifies communication and collaboration 
									 but also enhances the precision of referencing specific tube profiles, expediting decision-making and project advancement. 

									 <h3>Sample of the Naming Convention</h3>
									<div class="table-wrapper">
										<table class="alt">

								<h2>Project:Vehicle's Component Placement on Chassis structure</h2>

									<span class="date">January 2023 - April 2023</span></p>

							<div class="box">
								<p>
									My role extends beyond the technical intricacies of design; it also encompasses the strategic orchestration of crucial vehicle components within the UBC Solar car. 
									One of my key responsibilities involves determining the optimal location and placement of vital elements such as the Personal & Ballast Box, 
									Motor Controller, and Steering Wheel Rack and Pinion.</p>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/mchassis.jpg" alt="" style="border: 1.5px solid black;" /></span>
									This task involves a delicate balance of various factors: maximizing functionality, 
									optimizing weight distribution, and ensuring driver comfort. It's a puzzle where every piece needs to fit perfectly for the bigger picture to work seamlessly.
									To achieve this, I've engaged in the creation of a mock chassis prototype. This step is paramount in guaranteeing that these components not only find their place theoretically but also practically. 
									By integrating them into a realistic representation of the chassis, I can assess their positioning from multiple angles. 
									This process ensures that the components fit harmoniously, don't interfere with each other, and most importantly, provide an ergonomic and comfortable experience for the driver.
